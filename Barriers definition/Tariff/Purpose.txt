Purpose: protective and revenue tariffs
Second classification method is based on the purpose of a tariff. It can be protective tariff with aim of protecting domestic industry, agriculture and labour against foreign competition, by keeping foreign goods out of the country or by raising their prices on more competitive level with local products. The other type is revenue tariff, which is levied with aim to generate tax profit for the government. It is often used as the easiest method to collect revenue, by poorer nation. At this point, it is also worth to mention discriminatory tariffs, which are similar to protective tariffs, but are charged against goods coming from a particular country. Such action may be caused by either trade imbalance in exporting country or for political purposes.
