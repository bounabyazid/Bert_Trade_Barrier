Actually, the question is this - I carefully watched your videos about the first and second barabanniks - but since there is no engineering education, I am a historian by education, there are still questions about the electrical part filter, You can get an explanation - did you somehow calculate the power and some other parameters of the engine from the wipers of the car or did you just have this engine? And you can explain on your fingers - for the historian - what other electrical parts did you use> it seems easier for me with the mechanics , but with an electrician, no way.

This filler is very expensive for ultrasound. Which biofilter you choose yourself, it all depends on the principle of operation of the biofilter. The settler must be calculated according to the water flow - the water should be in a container for about 30 minutes for the sediment to settle. Not all suspensions are deposited from the clary catfish, since it secretes mucus that does not sink, so it is advisable to use a drum filter with a micro mesh. "

Firstly, it all depends on the parameters of the bioloading itself. Secondly, based on the parameters of the bioloading itself, its amount is calculated by the amount introduced Thirdly, water exchange plays an important role here. In the fourth, it still depends on the freshness (pure water added to the system), the more the freshness, the less bio-loading. Thus, it is possible to bring the recirculation system to the WTS, in which bioloading is not required at all but it wastes a lot of water. "

                    Although it is possible to heat water, it is very expensive. So it makes sense to grow Claria only in closed reservoirs. In theory, this pond can be covered. Make something like a greenhouse on top. Maybe a month and you can win. But this will certainly have to be invested. "

                    injected to one female should not exceed 1 ml. For example, 10 females with an average weight of 3 kg are selected for injection. The value of the first dose of the pituitary gland is 0.5 mg per 1 kg. Therefore, for the injection of 10 females, 3 x 10 x 0.5 = 15 mg of the pituitary glands are needed. With an average mass of 1 pituitary gland of 2.5 mg, 15: 2.5 = 6 pituitary glands are required. The volume of suspension for 10 females with the introduction of the first dose will be 0.5 x 10 = 5 ml, the second dose - 1 x 10 = 10 ml. "

Females and males need to be seated separately only three days before spawning, but you can keep them together. You need to feed the producers with good compound feed so that the sexual products develop normally. If the female is * pot-bellied *, then this already indicates the presence of eggs, as a last resort, in case of doubt, there is a biopsy to determine the quality of the eggs. "

In 10 cubic meters of water, about 10 tons of claria can be grown per year, although it all depends on the cyclicity of fish stocking. , but I take on average 10 tons per year. Here, of course, you will need tanks for rearing juveniles. So, approximately, consider the price of 1 kg of good feed, for example, Aller Aqua Primo Float, and multiply by 1.2 and get the approximate price of the cost of growing clary I repeat that this is an approximate estimate without taking into account the cost of the RAS equipment itself.

                    The highest rate of its replication is observed at 35 ° C, but the maximum accumulation - only at 30'C CPP is manifested during the formation of syncytia with the subsequent destruction of the cell layer. The virus is most stable in an environment with pH 6.0 - 6.5. Under ultraviolet irradiation (24 erg / mm2 / s) for 40 minutes, it completely loses its infectivity. At temperatures of 32, 27 and 15'C the virus is inactivated, and at 4'C it loses 50% of its activity in 4 weeks. At a temperature of minus 75'C the virus remains active and infectious for a year, and at minus 20'C for 6 months. Epizootological data. The disease is clinically and pathoanatomically manifested only in underyearlings and rarely in yearlings of catfish weighing 10 - 12 g. The manifestation and nature of the course of the disease depends on the environmental conditions of the environment. Factors contributing to the onset and exacerbation of the disease is an excessively high water temperature (30'C and above), a low content of oxygen dissolved in water, high oxidizability of water, superdense fish stocking, injury and disturbance of fish during its sorting and transplantation from one reservoir to another, as well as during the transportation of fish seed. The viral disease of young of the year canal catfish is often complicated by secondary bacterial infections (in particular, myxobacteriosis). Under the action of all the above conditions and a water temperature of 30'C, the death of fish can reach 85-100%, and at 20-25'C the disease, as a rule, proceeds chronically, the death of fish is insignificant. At water temperatures below 15'C, the disease does not manifest itself clinically. The incubation period at a water temperature of 25-28'C lasts no more than 3 days, and when it decreases, it lengthens to 10 - 12 days or more. The mass death of sick catfish occurs on the 5-7th day after the first symptoms of the disease appear. The source and reservoir of infection in nature are sick fish, their excrement (excrement), virus-carrying fish, dead fish corpses. Young catfish are infected by transmission of the virus from their parents to their offspring through caviar. Subsequently, the disease is transmitted through the contact of sick fish with healthy ones, as well as through infected water, contaminated equipment and fishing gear. In commercial fish, repair category and manufacturers, the disease does not manifest itself either clinically or pathologically. However, certain groups of fish can be virus carriers and serve as a source of infection of underyearlings and yearlings of catfish. Other fish species do not get sick with channel catfish viral disease. There is information in the literature about the possibility of experimental infection with this disease of blue (I. furcatus) and white catfish (I. catus). Symptoms. At the onset of the disease in young of the year, only general weakness and lethargy are noted: the fish passively swims near the coastal zone or hangs upside down in the water column, it can be taken with your hands, since it does not respond to external stimuli. After some time, the fish sinks to the bottom of the pool and dies. With the development of the pathological process on the body and fins of fish, hemorrhages of various shapes and sizes are formed. There is dropsy of the body cavity, bulging and pallor of the branchial apparatus. Pathological changes. Autopsy of sick or just dead fish reveals punctate and diffuse hemorrhages of muscles, kidneys, liver and intestinal wall. The spleen is pinkish, slightly enlarged. Kidneys and liver, despite hemorrhage, they are pale in color. In the abdominal cavity and in the stomach, as a rule, a yellowish straw or whitish liquid accumulates. All internal organs are edematous, their edges are smoothed. Pathogenesis has not been studied. The diagnosis is made on the basis of epizootological, clinical and pathological anatomical data, as well as the results of a virological study, in which the virus must be isolated. The reliability of the diagnosis is confirmed by a biological sample. Under experimental infection, underyearlings of channel catfish die 22 hours after infection and the virus is easily re-isolated from them, especially from the kidneys, where its concentration is highest. Bacterial infection is excluded by bacteriological research on the isolation of the causative agent of myxobacteriosis and bacterial renal disease. The disease goes on so fast that therapeutic agents are unlikely to be acceptable. In addition, the disease often proceeds as a viral-bacterial mixed infection, and therefore the selection of medications is complicated. When importing caviar and fish seed into our country, an international certificate should be required, certifying the absence of disease in fish in the supplying farm. Without this document, the material is not allowed to be imported into the USSR. In addition, fish seed and fertilized eggs should be sent to specialized quarantine farms, and the further movement of the imported fish is carried out in full accordance with the current instructions. -sanitary, fish-biological, fish-breeding-reclamation and zootechnical work, daily carried out in farms that are under the threat of a viral disease of channel catfish. including poultry) or fur-bearing animals in boiled form. The corpses of fish are burned or buried in the ground to a depth of at least 1.5 m away from the reservoir. Dysfunctional ponds or pools are disinfected with quicklime or bleach according to the standards adopted in fish farming. Quarantine is imposed on the farm, which is unfavorable for the catfish viral disease, a plan for the elimination of the disease is developed and all measures are carried out under the supervision of a veterinarian ichthyopathologist. The revitalized farm is put into operation in accordance with the current instructions. Sanitary assessment. The causative agent of the channel catfish viral disease is not dangerous for humans and carnivores. Fish from a dysfunctional reservoir, if it has not lost its presentation and condition, is allowed to be eaten by people without restrictions. Fish unmarketable and substandard (at the discretion of a veterinarian-ichthyopathologist) is sent to feed for farm animals in a boiled form. "

There is a concrete pool outside, covered with a film, I thought to swim in it in the summer)) Size 5 * 6 meters, depth 1.8 meters. Several years ago I tried to launch some carp there, in the summer he exhaled. According to the advice from the forums, he put an aerator with 2 diffusers. But at the bottom they do not work, they probably do not have enough power, they crush the water column. The air begins to squeeze out only if you raise it to about 5 meters from the surface. water from a well, a drain-second pump to the garden. These are currently the initial ones. There is an idea in the spring to buy 1000 pieces of clarified catfish, start somewhere from May. To grow it, what additional equipment is needed - a biofilter, a mechanical filter, etc. Is it worth doing this at all? It seems like there is a large pool, and the topic itself is interesting,but previous attempts were clumsy .. "

Anyway, to get a well-formulated answer, you need to ask a well-formulated question. "

                    In the house, after the pumping station, I installed a big blue 10BB mainline Geyser filter with a cartridge. That's my whole system. Now the iron dissolved in the water precipitates in the well and the hydrogen sulphide is weathered. The remains of iron are collected on a filter in front of the pumping station, and then the water is purified from the remains of dissolved iron in the Geyser. I wash the filter in front of the pumping station every 2-3 weeks. The filter in the Geyser was checked a month after the start of the system; it was practically clean. By the way, it is good to clean the filters in the Geyser in citric acid by soaking for a couple of days and use them further. I bought a replacement filter for replacement. Costs: Bag of Zeolite 20 kg with delivery -2100 rubles, compressor -1500 rubles, cartridge for Geyser-1275, body for Geyser-1900 rubles. Total 6675 =. Tips: installed taps before and after the Geyser to shut off the water when replacing the cartridge; before and after the filter of the pumping station for the same purpose a crane. It has become much more convenient to change and clean filters - no need to drain water from the entire system. compressor: Schego WS3Dimensions: 170x75x60 mm Power: 5 W Productivity: 350 l / h Regulator: yes Cable: 1 m Able to pump air to a depth of 3 meters inclusive. Price: Schego WS31479 rubles. "

                    1 The planting density of crayfish is not more than 8 kg per 1 square meter, and then this is probably a lot, since during molting they will simply injure or kill each other. It is imperative to make shelters 2 Air is calculated not by the volume of water, but by the weight and type of aquatic organisms 3 Biofilter calculated by the amount of feed introduced4 A frame pool made of film is not desirable, since it can be damaged by the crayfish themselves5 everything needs to be calculated, with crayfish it is not so easy as with fish, they need increased planting areas. In principle, you can lower the temperature to slow down metabolic processes.

                    When the oxygen content decreases to 4-5 mg / l, it is in a depressed state (the threshold content is 1.0-2.6 mg / l). Carbonic acid. The maximum permissible concentration (MPC) of carbon dioxide in water is 40-60 mg / l for trout. At a content of 30 mg / l, respiratory depression is observed, at 50-80 mg / l - an imbalance, at 107 mg / l trout swims on the side and back. Ammonia. Ammonia content equal to 0.3-0.4 mg / l, at a water temperature of 14 ° C and an oxygen content of 9-10 mg / l, causes the death of trout. The permissible concentration of ammonia is up to 0.5 mg / L. Chlorides, nitrides. Under normal conditions, the permissible concentration of nitrites is 0.1 mg / l, the norm for chlorides is up to 5 mg / l. Hardness. Water of medium hardness (8-12 mg / l) is favorable for trout breeding. Light and transparency. Trout avoids brightly lit areas, but prefers clear, clear waters. Suspensions, being in the water, being deposited on the gills, cause difficulty in breathing, reduce the activity of feeding, slow down growth and can lead to death. With age, trout tolerate increased salinity better. Larvae can withstand salinity only 5-8%, underyearlings - 12-14%, yearlings - 20-25%, adult trout 35%. Active reaction of the environment. The optimal active reaction of the trout habitat is neutral and slightly alkaline (pH 7-8). Toxicity. Hydrogen sulfide, even in small quantities, is toxic to trout. Zinc salts are toxic to trout. (Under no circumstances use zinc buckets, basins, pipes, etc. in the pond.) In addition, trout is also sensitive to chlorine content, even to such a concentration as 0.0002-0.0008 mg / l. Trout dies in chlorinated drinking water. A film of oil and oils on the water surface can be fatal for trout. It has been established that water with a neutral reaction of the medium (pH 7) is most suitable for growing trout, which contains 7-10 mg / l of oxygen, 10 mg / l of carbon dioxide, no more than 0.5 mg / l of albuminous nitrogen, no more than 0, 5 mg / l ammonia salts, up to 0.5 mg / l nitrites, up to 1 mg / l nitrates, 1 mg / l total iron, 5 mg / l sulfates, hardness 8-12 mg / l "

First of all, everything strongly depends on the size of the mesh cell. The smaller the cell, the more the filtration area is needed. The drum is calculated exactly according to the filtration area and the size of the mesh cell. It is also important the pollution of the water, which is primarily determined by the fish stocking density and the amount of feed introduced. Somewhere on the Internet there is a table of Hydrotech drum filters, according to which you can approximately calculate the required drum size. "

                    feeding rate 3% (8500 * 3% = 255kg / day) It turns out according to the average averaged calculation of bioburden (8kg - 1000m2 biosag): 255kg feed / 8kg * 1000=31875m2 If you take a load of 750m2m3, then it turns out 31875 * 1000/750 = 42.5 cubic meters of only one load, uzoooo.Is the calculations themselves made to determine the bioload and how to choose the right capacity for the required load volume, I thought you need 2-2.5 times more, that is, 42.5 * 2 = 85 cubic meters comes out the required capacity, or 2 containers of 45 cubic meters, or 4 containers of 22 cubic meters? II solution of the problem Since, due to my understanding and more in-depth planning, I have come to the point that the maximum loaded pools will not be simultaneously , as stocking will take place 4 times in 3 months. In the attached picture, we see that the planned maximum daily feed requirement in all pools (based on feeding: up to 360g sample -5% feed / day, 360g-1000g -3%) - is 82kg / day.Accordingly, knowing the maximum daily feed requirement, we make the appropriate calculations: 82kg / 8kg * 1000 = 10250m sq of bioloading If we take a load of 750m2m3, then it turns out 10250 * 1000/750 = 13.7 cubic meters of loading It turns out that you need a container of 13.7 cubic meters * 2.5 = 27.4 cubic meters or 2pcs of 14 cubes or 4pcs of 7 cubes Dear friends, I myself have no technical education, how to say office plankton I ))) I ask you to help me understand these intricacies of building a RAS, and I hope that, based on my example, many other beginners will be able to figure out some of the calculations themselves and the active users of this forum will increase in orders.

If we calculated that we need 1 cubic meter of loading, then how to determine the volume of the container itself, the assumptions will be true that 1.5 cubic meters of capacity is needed for 1 cubic meter of bioloading Or is it better to take twice as much, that is, 2 cubic meters? ?

The order of assembling option No. 3 of the purifier with your own hands: For mobile, for field hospitals (tents), hospitals, clinics and public places: Inside the premises (mount) we install a kitchen hood; (any hood is suitable) we mount a UV lamp in it and close it with a screen (aluminum foil) so that it does not dazzle the eyes.At the outlet of the hood we mount a drainage system, put an adapter of the required diameter (angle, tee, etc.) Connect to the pipeline, (stretching the aluminum corrugation, or we make a set of plastic pipes of the required diameter) In the containers used (we need at least four containers) We make holes for the diameter of the pipes We mount the UV lamps inside in all containers In container No. 1 we attach the inlet pipe near the very bottom We mount the second outlet pipe at the highest point of the container, for this you will need corners. We fix it in all containers of the UV lamp. Similar to the first container; the inlet pipe is near the bottom, the outlet is similar to the top, Further in the same order To the third and fourth, etc. Tank # 1 is half-filled with the Disinfecting mixture (a mixture of alcohol and glycerin). Tank # 2 is half-filled with a mixture of water and oil. Tank no. 3 is half-filled with clean water. Tank no. 4 with a dry filter element - katrizh. Exhaust air from the room goes into container No. 1 and is half filled with a disinfecting mixture (a mixture of alcohol and glycerin). Alcohol is necessary to break down the envelope of the virus Glycerin, light, viscous, enveloping, the exhaust air flow passed through the immersed end of the pipe. Passing the passed air through the holes rises to the top, while the air bubbles together with different particles rising upward, the particles are enveloped in the mixture, connecting together forming heavier particles that settle to the bottom are retained in the container, under the action of a UV lamp, ultraviolet radiation purifies the air, killing viruses and bacteria, leaving through another outlet that is connected to another container of the flask. The next container of the flask with a mixture of water and oil passing air bubbles rising to the top, to the outlet, the flasks pass through the solution with an aqueous mixture with an oily film, which is located in the upper part, enveloping the residues, additionally cleans and heavy parts additionally settle to the bottom, and under the action of the second UV lamp of ultraviolet radiation they additionally purify the air, killing viruses and bacteria further air passes from the second to the third container. Where the exhaust air flow passing through is immersed in half of clean water, which is above the free end, rising to the top, it is additionally cleaned of all residues, irradiated with the help of UV paws, straggling viruses and bacteria die, then the air passes into another - fourth container through the filter, irradiated by UV lamps, straggling viruses and bacteria die, additionally it is cleaned of residues, then the air flow goes out through the outlet to the outside cleaner, Using special germicidal lamps DRT with a power range (100-1200 W) are used in medical devices, ultraviolet irradiation of a microorganism in water and air is carried out. Under the action of UV irradiation, microorganisms that die which lose the ability to reproduce. As a result, the process of reproduction of microorganisms stops. Thus, purification is carried out (killing bacteria and viruses), thereby sterilizing the air in medical places; mobile, field hospitals, hospitals, clinics and in public institutions, killing harmful bacteria and viruses.

                    I do not advise starting with incubation, it is rather difficult. Without certain knowledge, experience and equipment, it is hardly possible to get normal sturgeon offspring, especially in a room of 6 sq / m. The caviar is sealed in bags with oxygen and it can be transported for about 3 days, maybe more, I don't know for sure.

If you can still not torment you a lot with questions:) If trout or sturgeon Take a more powerful aerator than an aquarium aerator, will it cope with oxygen saturation? cube, we are talking about electric heating? A couple more questions:) Water - is it possible to use water from the tap to pre-settle it in the aquarium? For sturgeons and trout, the water is also from the tap, settled. The idea is this (for any type of fish) Use a frame pool in the basement at home, next to it is an aquarium with separated water for a change, then connect a 9 cubic meter pool to this system, as a result we get a system with a volume of more than 10 cubic meters for 150-200 fish. Trout and sturgeon do not bother in general, if only tap water and the question open for oxygen.With successful attempts to grow fish, we can talk about a more detailed approach to fur and bio filters, as well as about saturating the water with oxygen, if the heating budget is not large, then I would still try Claria, with it it is a little easier and less expensive for testing.

In general, after a little thought, I came to the conclusion that I will start with Claria, because he is not so whimsical to oxygen, therefore, uzv is less dependent on electricity in the network.Start with 3 eurocubes, a common biofilter, a common sump and a mechanical filter. The planting density is 600 pieces in two eurocubes, as the sorting proceeds, the fines are deposited in the third eurocube, so the density will be 200 pieces per cubic meter. There are a couple of questions about this: Will there be enough barrels of 200-250 liters for a biofilter? Is the mechfilter just a drum or is there a simpler alternative? At the first stage, there is no point in building up this kind of mechanism, and buying is quite expensive, although I understand that it costs the money.

Even if we take into account Andrey's feed at 32 UAH per kg, then we get the cost of 1 kg of fish about 40-45 UAH.

Maybe one of the participants will tell you the prices for what they donate catfish in different regions of Ukraine. to donate 50 UAH and earn something, you need to feed the catfish with pine sawdust, because alder sawdust sells for 40 UAH a bag :))) Uzv-shniki,how do you survive in such conditions or is it just an expensive hobby for you ???

Before calculating the principle For the work of the BF, you need to know the useful area of ​​the bioload and its density relative to water. Without these parameters, you cannot calculate the BF correctly. I have a video on the YouTube channel about measuring the useful area of ​​the bioload, everything is described in detail there. "

When such a miracle disappears, after two or three days they begin to eat. It’s hard for all of them to swim. Painfully calm.

            There were not so many people who agreed to sell me the fertilized eggs. And there were those who, having heard the problem, tried to earn, for example, one who wanted 30,000 rubles for fertilized eggs. In the end, I found a kind person who, one might say, was imbued with my problem and said that he was glad to help at the time of smooth fertilization of the eggs and could do it for me. I had a plan in my head. I come to take fertilized eggs in a suitcase and on the plane and home. Logically, I thought that all this would be as fast as possible. In fact, there is no direct flight from the place of obtaining caviar to me. Bus 8 hours to the airport 3 hours on the fly 2 hours in the airport, check-in and all that 1 hour from my airport to the place and that 8 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 14 hours. The fertilized one will not survive. We thought separately caviar separately milk. But 14 hours can not be shortened. We thought to come by car. I'll tell you some exotic ideas. Weiss portable flask. But knowledgeable people said that we need at least 3 cubic meters of water. in this case. we thought that we had to come and find a gazelle in a foreign country three euro cubes to agree that he drove us to the border at the border we take out the game in a jar with a minimum of water passing the border and there we are waiting for another gazelle with euro cubes. We thought it was a Hollywood action movie, but what to do. They have already started looking, but experts stopped us abruptly, the reason for the crossing of the border of the caviar will be already 15 hours from the moment of fertilization, they said that everything in this bank will die out. We began to think further. They wanted to transfer the breeding stock. The frontiers said that the fish is not alive. We began to think further. They came up with a cleverly clever plan, I don't know the truth, how much it is really needed, and advice from the citizens. I take the breeding stock in my car in two 200 liter barrels.

It all depends on the degree of processing. The simplest thing will probably be to smoke the fish, since for example dried clary catfish is nothing good. And smoked catfish is considered a huge delicacy. If you raise the issue of conservation, then the processing process itself becomes much more complicated, although at one time I closed silver carp and grass carp for myself 100 cans, but without sterilization such canned food do not last long.
