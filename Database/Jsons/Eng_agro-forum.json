A vast group of jawnfish, which are characterized by gill breath at all stages of postembryonic body development. The fish are common in both salty and fresh water, from deep ocean adhesions to mountain streams. Fish play an important role in most aquatic ecosystems as a component of food chains. They are of great economic importance to human consumption.\n\n  The size of modern fish varies from 7.9 mm to 20 meters (Kite shark). There are 32,834 fish species in the world (2013). Each year, about 300 to 500 new species are described. There are about 3,000 species in Russia, including more than 280 species of fresh water.","Nb Answers":0,"Answers":[],"Nb pages":1,"Answer pages":["http:\/\/agro-forum.net\/threads\/5400\/page-1"]},{"Title":"Dose-Agro: new agricultural standards","Url":"http:\/\/agro-forum.net\/threads\/3757\/","username":"D-Mir","Date":"28 Oct 2015 at 15:42","Text":"In the sphere of agriculture, all new trends are born, which are aimed at the development of this industry. Thus, a new high-technology mode of agriculture-aquapnik-has become a popular phenomenon to date.  This involves growing water animals and plants without soil.\n\nAquaponics are understood to mean an artificial ecosystem in which three types of living organisms are key: aquatic animals (usually fish), plants and bacteria. Such technology is entirely environmentally sound. It works on the ecosystem of fish and plants: fish provide food to plants, and plants purifying water. The essence of the technology is that the waste of aquatic animals (fish, shrimp) is used as a breeding ground for plants.\n\nThe thing is that fish emit toxic products for themselves: nitrous, potassium, phosphorus compounds, carbon dioxide. The accumulation of these substances in water presents the main problem in both closed industrial aquaculture and in the simple aquarium. But at the same time, these waste is necessary for growing plants. Fish products are added to water to produce nutrients for plants.\n\nAquaponics: what is the point?\n\nAquaponics means the joint cultivation of plants and fish. For this, two containers are used: one for the fish that should be located at the bottom and the other for the plants. Fish products that are left behind, which are toxic, have a negative impact on their health. Thus, the reservoir where the fish are located is permanently polluted. The water needs to be cleaned. In this task, plants are performing well, for which waste serves as the ideal fertilizer. \n\nAs a result water with fish is pumpinged into the upper reservoir with plants that get all the necessary nutrients, and the tank with the fish is already treated with purified water. This option is ideal and, most importantly, non-waste. This kind of business is very profitable, and the investment is minimal.\n\nThe important point is that you will have to take care of a balanced diet for fish. Some agro-producers choose to use low-class fishmeal. But that's not the best option. The production of feed combine on specialized equipment is the optimal solution, as you will control the preparation of fodder. The production enterprise of Doza-Agro will help you choose the feed equipment.\n\nOn materials: \"Doza-Agro\"\n\nSite: http:\/\/dozaagro.ru\/\n\nTel: 8-800-200-24-76; 8 (831) 242-05-00\n\nE-mail: office@dozaagro.ru","Nb Answers":0,"Answers":[],"Nb pages":1,"Answer pages":["http:\/\/agro-forum.net\/threads\/3757\/page-1"]},{"Title":"Rybnadzor","Url":"http:\/\/agro-forum.net\/threads\/212\/","username":"Cyrus","Date":"21 Oct 2012 at 20:30","Text":"Is there any relation with Rybnadzor to my private fishing industry?
